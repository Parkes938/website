        <h2>The history behind it</h2>
        The swingarm is my latest venture in the run of component development. I have always experienced a huge amount of flex as I up the pace on corner entry. A full body weave as if it were hinged in the middle. The frame is still a work in progress but that aside I considered in principal that a road derived old cast swingarm is probably lacking in stiffness. You only need to look back to the alterations done by HRC 20 years ago to see it had issues. I wasn’t too impressed with their tactics though. They produced a thick 6mm plate that you could weld onto the top of the swingarm to add lateral stiffness. What a bodge! Then you could buy various cast variations with additional internal webs. They gave in and went double sided which is a logical step. I’m sticking with the single sided for now as I want to maintain the ability for fast wheel changes.

	  	  	         <h2>The old one</h2>
        Back into 2012 when the project first started I welded a bracing structure on top of the swingarm which was a token gesture to stiffness (it was pants). I cut a standard swingarm open to examine the casting thicknesses and sections throughout. I was quite surprised to see how much material there was particularly around the shock linkage mount. I could see some good scope for improvement around the hub end. The ‘jaws’ as I call them that grasp the hub are equally poorly supported and could see a lot of flex. An improvement would be to make one side of the jaw short and rigid whilst reducing the length of the opposing jaw as much as possible in an effort to reduce both lateral and torsional flex.

        <h2>The new one</h2>
        First job was to benchmark the stiffness of the standard one which I had braced. I made a quick jig out of scrap steel to mount it rigidly and employed the services of a calibrated father figure to lean against it. The theory was to mark a spot on the floor about a meter away from the centre of the hub and get my dad to place his toes on the line. Then simply lean onto the swingarm, placing his hands on it first but allowing it to just touch his chest. I then took the measurements from the wall both before and after. That was my benchmark; 2mm of deflection measured at the furthest point on the swingarm.

        <h2>The result</h2>
        Now I know what you’re thinking; where’s the consistency? No food was allowed in or out of the tester once testing commenced and the measurements were done 3 times on each just to make sure the blood flow was in all the right places.
		The swingarm is constructed with 5083 throughout purely because it avoids the need for post weld heat treatment. Pivot mounts and hub clamp were machined from roled solid. Cast blocks are easy to obtain but roled offers slightly greater grain alignment but are harder to come by. Sheet sections are 3mm thick in the H111 condition, rolled and pressed using my excellent old flypress and rollers and then welded with 5356 rods. I love old equipment; solid cast iron. I am adament in years to come equipment like this will be the cherished like precious religious jewels. We are just coming out of the 'scrap it' phase so now is still a good time to buy.

        <h2>Other additions</h2>
        To finish of the fabrication I made a cushless drive hub along with a new eccentric hub and spindle of my own design to give greater resistance to radial loads. I tested and raced the standard setup at 150hp and found nothing significant other than perhaps slightly accelerated bearing wear prodimantly due to the removal of the cush drive.
