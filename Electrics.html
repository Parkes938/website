        If you manage to find a talented dyno tuner; consider adoption! Gold dust doesn't come close to describing the rarity
        of a truly skilled dyno operator and tuner. It seems with the evolution of technology on todays motorbikes the skills necessary to identify and mitigate
        spurious readings and failures has all but faded away in place of user friendly, simplified ECU's.<br>
        I had the challenge of writing the sequencing of crank, cams, injectors and ignition from scratch. 
        Calculating the trigger points and degrees from edges of lobes was a big headache; I learned by adjusting and listening (and smelling)
        what was happening.
        Through the years I have been involved in engine tuning I have seen a few good dyno tuners retire due to a shortfall in demand. The few remaining that I used
        weren't able to help. I really needed to have full use of the dyno so that I could monitor all the sensor readouts as I worked my way through the RPM and load ranges.
        I lost a freshly built engine to one dyno operator who held the motor on a wide open throttle against a fully braked roller.<br>
        From that moment I had to find a more accesible alternative. My solution was a micro data station and logger which would give me everthing on one readout.
        Live Lambda, pressures, temperatures, rpm all on a bright OLED screen; that way I can see exactly what's happening and make changes accordingly.
        Programming the chips was alien to me and I had massive help from a friend who did 99% of the head work; I am still learning how to take the lead on that one.

        <h2 align="left">Fine tuning</h2>
        There are lots of small gains within a fully programmable ECU which with time can transform a engine to become smooth and refined. Take the secondary injectors for example;
        I actually looked to using an additional set of injectors back in the airbox out of necessity rather than absolute performance. The large primary
        injectors were approaching 10ms openings towards the top rpm. At those figures I was risking burning out the injectors as the solenoids inside them
        are effectively being held open too long. Switching to proportionally split the fuel between banks of injectors at high rpm allowed the solenoids to get an easier life and
        generate better atomisation of the fuel.<br>
        The position at which the injector is fired is less critical but definately necessary; you need to have an appreciation of the dwell, air flow velocity and fuel atomisation in
        order to govern how far in advance of top dead centre the fuel must be dispensed so that it neither hits the back of valve, or at worst; fall out of suspension onto the port walls.

        I made a simple 3 phase generator to make use of the quieter nights in front of the TV, relentlessly wrapping coil after coil. The output is fairly modest
        due to the low surface area of magnets on the inner rotor. My next move is to look at creating an overun to the flywheel to maintain inertia on deceleration and therefore
        keep the charge up for free. There will of course be losses to friction of the sprag clutch.

I have been quitely plotting an interesting project into deformable body working. I won't give too much away yet, but it will be an aerodynamic feature actuated relative
      to the air speed/ pressure at the front of bike.
