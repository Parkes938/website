        <h2>The history behind it</h2>
        Where it all began back in 2012 where a seed was planted in my mind that having ridden many modern bikes across club and national series I found I was lacking the ability to find the limits of the machines without first finding it by crashing. Something I did regularly in my early days of racing Ducati’s on the worst tyres the club came by; taking homage of any discount offered regardless of quality. Reluctant to pursue a relentless pursuit of a refined regurgitation I started to think about what I wanted from a bike to enable me to go faster. Not knowing much about anything but naively believing I did led me to thinking there was a relationship missing; the psychology of what was below me; if I believed it was capable, how faster could I go?
To go against the grain and start enjoying racing again I purchased a £900 VFR800 that had been pulled out of the sea in Southampton in 2012. My plan was to always build a frame but what it would look like and what materials were mere minor details; it would happen in good time.

        <h2>The business</h2>
        A few years passed by where I persisted to run my own motorcycle service workshop and sub contract as an engineer to make up the 7 day working week, blindly making money to satisfy a part of my brain which believed that the road to fortune would bring happiness. I took the VFR in fairly standard trim; albeit with my own fairings, exhaust and mildly tuned engine to the southern 100 amongst many club races for 2 years along with a 2nd modern bike to keep my eye in whilst I developed the VFR. The modern bikes kept me sharp for a while until a daft crash at the southern in 2014. When lying 2 inches under the whining Connor Cummins in the chopper I decided that I was done with the boredom of modern racing; tired of the same of 600’s and 1000’s being painted a different colour with excessively expensive fancy folding levers because they can’t find anything else to spend the money on. At the time I had spent some hefty money; nearly £8K on my 1 year old 675R which got me around 15th in the A 600 class. Not willing to re-morgage my house for all the fancy extras or constant travels to all the race circuits to get sharp I threw my dummy out, no more pretending. At the same time I had learned that money wasn’t for me, life was for living. I am a big believer now that you are what you do and to a certain extent; what you look like too. There a few exceptions which fascinate me; those few who you’re sure you think you have sussed but blow you away with a life far less ordinary. If I was going to work all day every day I would look like I had! If I worked on everyone else’s bike I wouldn’t get any smarter and know how to build a chassis. Education is for those who can’t do, so my ethos is to crack on and learn the hard way.

        <h2>Get stuck in</h2>
        I returned from the Island and set about getting some T45 tube and some oxyacetylene and cracking on. Drying the sand and ramming it in to produce a hot bend took a lot of practice and I’d say 2 years of 10’s of bends to get that real feel for what’s going on. Every technical hurdle would spark a brief research through textbooks but something I was always adamant of was to stay away from any design or guidance that had been done before. If it exists I’m not interested in it. I needed to ensure my designs and philosophy was fresh and untainted. That way I felt my mind would have a greater chance of conjuring up something new which wasn’t a result of computer simulation pre-configured, logical algorithms which exist based on old theories (what’s the point – at best you would just be copying someone else!) In later years it would make my blood boil when some punk would glance at the bike in the holding area and ask ‘what is it mate’, ‘is that a ducati swingarm’, ‘who’s are those fairings’. Knowing I was the underdog in an international race gave my clarity of thought to say; ‘no, I made it all myself’. The following years have given me a massive understanding for metallurgy and thermal dynamics. 7 engines later and 3 rising rate suspension geometries have taught me a lot and the near death experiences around the southern 100 even more. Take a look at the technical journeys across the site and maybe look out for upcoming events… you’ll hear it coming for sure!

        <h2>So who am I?</h2>
        So who am I? My name is Tom Parkes, I’m 31 at the time of writing this and have been building and racing my own chassis for 3 years now. The deeper I go, the more sense it makes; the big OEM’s are bound by performance metrics; fearful of research and design with professional rider’s balls bursting for success. Who would want to risk it all and fail like those that have come and gone before. Let someone else do the innovation and graft and the crafty ways of the east will pluck it like they did in the 70’s and spend the proceeding decades refining it! Despite not getting on the podium at the toughest race tracks in the world; I believe it’s very early days and unbeknown to most, I can see some real potential in it. At slower speeds it’s the best bike I’ve ever ridden, smoother than Trumps sack but yet solid and compliant, with do whatever you want whilst your braking steering. Just don’t go too fast into corners, just not yet anyway!
