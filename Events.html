        <h2>The development program</h2>
        The bike has had a tough few years; 10 months of development and 2 months out on the track for the past 3 years; with frequent frantic machining in that 2 months too! So 2018 will be more composed; perhaps using the isle of man race events as a first test for 10 months of development is unorthodox? Or maybe i'm just optimistic about the potential. 2018 will be a healthier mix of UK based safe circuits to develop the chassis, experiment with swingarm lengths and monitor cooling characterisitcs as the further engine modifications are installed.

        <h2>Club Racing</h2>
        I tend to enter the club races at the last minute pending succesful fabrications so watch this space for upcoming short circuit races
      </div>
      <div class="grid-right-three">
        <h2>Road Racing</h2>
        It wouldn't be right to design and build a road race bike and not use it as such; This years line up will be different, we're holding back on entering isle of man and irish road races at the moment:
		- Registered interest to compete in the new Welsh Road Race

      <div class="grid-wide-center">
        <h2>Trackdays</h2>
        Trackdays and ACU test days tend to be wasteful for this bike. Typical modifications take weeks of machining and fabrication so I tend to be going home early if there's a problem. If I need track time to refine suspension then I'll go for a test day
      </div>
      <div class="grid-wide-center">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        The bike has seen many revisions to chassis and engine over the past 3 years it has been seriously developed the results have been consistantly poor, most races have been in preservation mode due to severly high engine temperatures. There was only one occasion when everything worked; qualifying in the wet at the southern 100 in 2015. The water spray has a brilliant capability to disspatae heat from the radiators. I was riding around many top flight bikes who were tip toeing around. I managed to qualify mid pack in the superbike race which was pleasing considering at the time I had 100hp less than the front runners.
