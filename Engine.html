        <h2>The history behind it</h2>
        It has taken me 5 years on and off to develop the engine in amongst all of the other tasks. As it stands today it is fairly reliable and quite modestly powerful but I can see that I am reaching the limits of potential with the crankcases. It has been quite a learning experience and I have stumbled across some interesting tricks which you wouldn’t normally find in most tuned engines.

        <h2>The steady learning</h2>
        I lacked the time and resource to do back to back testing to really validate individual gains in components. It’s difficult to describe in words but from spending so much time immersed in each and every component in the way I have, coupled with experience from previous tuning you can attribute a factor of contribution to the power gains and equate approximate results to these areas. When a component or commodity contributes a far greater gain than expected you can start to explore the how’s and why’s; which for me led me to stumbling on 2 interesting areas; the induction turbulence and cylinder pressures.

        <h2>Lots to do</h2>
        To be honest if I had written this a year ago I would have told you the piston profile was the most important contribution. Or maybe the year before that would have been mechanical losses and friction. Appreciate it’s just a snapshot of one man trying to run a factories worth of development rather than a comprehensive engine tuning tutorial. I seem to have a hopelessly short memory; what I don’t document is sometimes lost, even though I felt I had mastered it at the time; something to do with my concentration for academia and the reasons I naturally take to making rather than read; I can just go and fabricate something with very little planning or knowledge and be totally immersed in it but when I need to concentrate on designing a new camshaft, clutch or steering system, I end up singing, tapping or day dreaming within seconds and drift in and out of focus without reward. Noticeable back when I was an art student back in my teens too. Are we still talking engines?

        <h2>Tech talk</h2>
        Over the years there has been lots of dyno time. Back in 2014 when I did my first stage of reboring out to 836cc I spoke to Tony scott and we decided that the nikosil composite liners are worth testing to the limit. The liners were a special aluminium alloy impregnated with nikosil throughout rather than surface coated however so I learned the saturation of nikosil content was not consistent through the material. I also degraded it’s heat conductivity, structural rigidity and surface finish away from an ideal as I bored it to leave only 1.5mm of wall thickness of the liner. Needless to say it lasted a mere 40 minutes on the dyno before it picked up and started to loose power. Enough time to map the majority of the lower end and do a power run. It was such a great experience using Freddys dyno; not only did it take 6 hours after a full days work to set it up and bolt it to the dyno, come midnight we were sat outside the room, I was controlling the aircraft style joystick hooked upto the throttle cable while freddy did the load resistance. The ecu needed half a second in each box to verify the revs, lambda and throttle position sensor before making the fuelling change so we had to scan lots of dials and watch for temperature fluctuations and power at the same time. Full on concentration but so rewarding. Modern day systems for big car companies do all this automatically now, pre programmed dyno sequences to tune and test. We finished up around 2am, I had nearly a 2 hour drive home then up at 6 for work. It didn’t matter, I was stoked. Subsequent rebuilds and a few iron liners later I was back for more; it was now an 848cc. I had taken it from 136hp to 142hp. The first engines reved all the way to 14,000 rpm, newer motors were more ballsy in the mid range and fizzed out by 12,000 rpm – it was intentional; my focus was corner exit speed. Something I witnessed first hand at the southern 100; off the start and finish line I was absolutely matched with all the superbikes for acceleration from a stand still even with 142hp but down 3 gears and enter the first corner, back on the gas and every bike made 10 metres on me within a second; there was no more power scotty. Rate of acceleration and gas speed were way down. Reciprocating mass was good as was friction losses but the difference in speed were embarrassing and possibly dangerous.

        <h2>2017</h2>
        2017 brought the big bang engine, out to 938cc now; long stroke, stronger lighter conrods, new exhausts and most importantly a different firing order. Over to Kev’s dyno in Cradley for this one as Freddy had closed up. Kev’s is a rolling road; a good one but still only a rolling road, they have limitations and harder to quickly change loads to do the mid range work but far simplier to load the bike on at least! April 2017 saw the new motor make 150hp at 13,400 rpm.
The 180 degree firing order is sublime to ride; silky smooth. The theory is the distance, consistency and balance of loads emitted from a combustion explosion to inertia at the wheel. Take a big v twin like a ktm; each piston is a dinner plate, with every nuclear sized explosion there is a huge momentary surge in torque exerted through the crankshaft, huge strain on the primary drive gears which quickly dissipates through normal mechanical losses as it finds it’s way through the gearbox down the chain to the back wheel by which time the next explosion has just taken place in the other cylinder, brace brace brace, here it comes, hold on tyre, are you ready. That surge in power graphically would form large waves of peaks and troughs which in theory exerts greater spikes in torque to the back tyre to compensate for the fact it only fires 2 big dinner plate pistons which will wear it out faster and give higher chance of high siding. Now compare that to a 180 v4; each spike of power will be lower as each cylinder produces less power and the spread between them is narrower meaning less loss of inertia and greater consistency in reciprocating torque; producing a smoother, calmer, safer ride with a tyre that lasts longer. I think slowly the likes of Ducati and Honda are really sold on this. I’m pretty sure all motogp bikes are v4 or v5 for that very reason, eventually all the road sports bikes will be V’s (hopefully) the world will be a better place

        <h2>Where next?</h2>
        Some useful upgrades due for 2018, new design of valve spring and different ports are first. I would love to manufacture my own engine. It would really seal the package as a true Parkes motorcycle. The only issue is time and a bit of finance. I have turned down all sponsorship to date as I really wanted to do it all of my own back. I think I would need to be realistic and if I were to open up the crankcase casting chapter I would reach out to those willing companies for help.
