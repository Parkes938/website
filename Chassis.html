        <h2>The history behind it</h2>
        The chassis to some is a work of art, but to me it is heavy, flawed and at best an amateur job. It cost around £400 in T45 which is huge money for tube. The brazing took months and all the machined bearing points took weeks of precision tuning as they were pressed into T45 brazed lugs which were then slightly out of round and as such required the bearing housings to be slightly out of round on the o.d to match; yes I did try to heat and morph to size but the heat normalised the 7075 which then became slack once cooled so to maintain the precision fit a very careful measure and ovality had to be applied.

        <h2>The winter months</h2>
        Every winter has brought reams of expectations of improvement for the following year and 2017 was a huge advance on 16. Although I was lucky to survive 2016, it was downright dangerous; not only by the fact that anything over 140mph with the incorrect placement of the centre of pressure put straight line stability on par with an early Triumph on Nitro. You had to work flat out just to keep it out of the walls. On top of that the steering was severely flawed. A new set of fairings the following winter took 3 months of plastercene carving and many evenings sat staring; picturing how the air would flow through and around the bike. Anyway; the steering; something I failed to properly rectify for 2017 too, which led to a heart stopping moment on the last lap of the senior through church bends. Prior to entering the corner I was convinced something was getting progressively slacker but carried on; I was already only riding at about 80% for the whole race so had room for error because it was so wild due to the fact that opposing high gyroscopic forces resulted in a good 50mm of free play at the end of the bars when tackling those heavy changes in direction; meaning total lack of control of the wheel. Anyway, approaching church bends; hold onto 3rd, wait for the limiter at 13,600, hard on the brakes and throw it in late on the right, use the engine braking to just scrub the last bit. Entry speed must be around 60-70mph? When you have no ability to turn the bars the rider’s ability to lean the bike drastically reduces. I had nothing, the wheel was it’s own, the bars were disconnected. I gripped the tank like I was wing walking bare back and used my body to heave it right and coasted around the left. I couldn’t decide where to stop as I wondered if braking would fold the front end and leave me in an embarrassing heap or worse steer me into the track so I coasted all the way to the last corner where I could just go straight on and park it into a tall kerb. When I came to a stop a bolt had failed in the steering linkages due to my poor design. Home time, hit the bottle, give up on life and take up golf. I was embarrassed more than anything, I looked like a hobo who made his own shoes out of a stale loaf.

        <h2>Suspension</h2>
        The double wishbone design might seem familiar to a lot of enthusiasts from first glance; it is not novel by appearance but only in it’s true geometry does it differ from any other. I did not compare or measure any other system to produce mine. The lever ratio, wishbone lengths or positions, wheel rate, rake and trial are all just positions I chose purely based on what I thought would be right. Many paper, cardboard and wooden models helped. I checked the numbers after I rode it for a year to see how it compared to others and found some interesting differences. There is good ground for improvement at least. The key was I didn’t want to be steered in a direction based on what others had produced. I needed a fresh slate.

        <h2>Developments</h2>
        Overtime I plan to make a 5083 chassis, purely because it won’t need to be heat treated but also to eradicate the excessive flex on those high speed, high lean corners. Something difficult to triangulate back from the front pivot points with tube given the space constraints of an airbox and tank in the way. The tubular chassis is fine for girly track work but road racing opens it up like a hollow point and makes you feel like tonto at high speed on those bumps. The brazing was done with sifbronze no1 1.6mm rods; the people who know will cringe here; I filed all the welds back to a smooth finish. It’s mainly because I brazed it all with a very harsh tip which got the metal too hot and didn’t give me the control to put a nice pretty fillet into the joint; instead I got a great capillary action but just too hot and dispersed to quick. By filing the fillets I’ve thinned out the strength of it but they haven’t cracked yet. I think the thickness of the fillets is more of a concern for it’s ability to withstand a crash or extreme bumps with shocks that over travel and go solid.

        <h2>The verdict</h2>
        It’s braking ability is fantastic, although probably only to me as it removes feel and gives a false level of comfort. Once I start pushing as hard as I need to be at the pointy end (which it isn’t ready for yet) I would likely to be losing the front trying to overtake people without warning. Conventional forks let you know what’s going on and limit the result somewhat. My design technically allows higher braking forces to be applied given the same conditions and contact patch but that limit can only be found with a blessing from the almighty or a frequent flyer permit on that chopper again. The load transfer under heavy braking is dissipated through the frame; very different to conventional forks where it ends up cumulating at the tyre and squishing that contact patch to a non-uniform splat which is hard to turn out of. Along with the massive shift in sprung weight and it’s catastrophic effects on geometry. Why only me? Because I trust it more than anyone else who dare straddle it.
Brazing is tricky but very DIY achievable. Cleanliness and patience are key and not too much heat as I was slow to find. Lots of people seem to see brazing as a black art, I put it with growing a bonsai; easy with patience, a bit like fusion welding titanium; that’s no different than baking a cake. A lot harder to design a structure to accommodate all the loads than to stick it all together.
An interesting food for thought is the potential advantages for dynamic lateral and torsional stiffness; could a frame that gets progressively stiffer with speed offer benefits? I have found my chassis to feel fantastic on an opening lap with a huge smile on my face which soon gets wiped off as I wind it up on the following laps. Perhaps a pressurised sealed chassis structure with a small sealed circuit; exhausting and re-filling offering small internal dynamic support for flex? It would sure put my welds to the test!
