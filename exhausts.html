        <h2>The history behind it</h2>
        The journey into exhausts was guided by cost. I bought quite a trick pipe bending table but it just wasn’t upto thin walled tube, especially the shapes I wanted to produce. I really needed to be able to offer each section up to the engine and frame which is nearly impossible to do with both cold and hot bends. The sand filled bend is a good one but only if the exhaust comes first and the rest of the body and electrics follows.
My first few systems were actually for customers bikes, one or 2 ducati’s were the first and simple too. They weren’t that great; the welds were deep and wide. I couldn’t get the fusion weld right because I couldn’t afford the right kit. I was cutting each section with an angle grinder and trying to get them flat with a flap wheel. Do that 100 times and you’ll start dreaming of a chop saw too. Invariably there were gaps because I didn’t put argon in the pipes too (didn’t want to use up too much gas did I – not cheap argon)
By the time I came around to make my first v4 system I did a back to back trial on the dyno with a mandrel bent tube system and discovered something interesting which do this day I still don’t fully understand but I know roughly how to repeat it and all I’ll say is it puts a smile on my face when I hear folk stating exhausts are all about smooth radius bends and back pressure. It’s something you can’t achieve with your off the shelf system but they sell enough of them so what do they care.

        <h2>Where it came from</h2>
        Most lobster sections are made for aesthetic reasons. I have come across small articles referring to the unpredictable wizardry of tumbling harmonic waves and the scavenging pressures they induce but they all concluded it doesn’t make sense. It would be interesting to hear if others have played with this and what they found.

        <h2>More is better</h2>
        It’s a real shame that exhaust manufactures don’t advertise the benefits and trade off’s for various exhaust designs. They seem to offer the one and only ‘off the shelf’ solution for that bike with a choice of pretty silencers. There’s not one tyre that does all grounds and conditions; most have a sticker with ratings for economy and wet road handling. Imagine what a tyre would perform like if they got rid of this and kept you in the dark and simply gave you what you thought was best for everyone and how much better the bike next to you would go if he knew what tyre he (or she) needed! As competition and skills develop the demand for performance is greater. Unfortunately the average buyer wants top end, balls out of the bath, check me out horse power potential so the market has followed the demand; can’t blame them.

        <h2>The science</h2>
        The exhausts I have made follow some slightly different calcs compared to what most seem to be using. To give a condensed summary, my pipes tend to be smaller in i.d, longer in length and normally use particular type of merge venture where required. When making thin walled sections you need to be very careful with residual stress. Even a small amount will induce a crack within 100miles; fluctuations in heat can increase and decrease this significantly; sometimes wrapping the headers can prolong the life of a suspect system by maintaining a slightly more stable condition and dampen the ambient harmonics induced from the pulses of firing and mechanical reciprocation. But maybe forget that as ACU rules stipulate you can’t use heat wrap on exhausts?
